                        Staying hydrated is important when it gets more hot out,
                        and if you are drinking it can help prevent that nasty
                        hangover.

                        While we all like to get riggedy rekt sometimes it's 
                        important to not overdo it and cause some serious
                        damage.

                        Instead of becoming a blob on the couch, try to get
                        outside and maybe get some exercise.

                        Maintain a semi-healthy diet, instead of just eating 
                        a lot of food. Having a good diet will help you feel 
                        better and you may lose some weight.
